Only you
Oh oho no, yeah
You are the light in my day
You're brighting my day
When I see you
I know I'd be okay
You are the one that I feel
And you know that it's real
When I think of you
I know I'd be okay
It's you my love
Anytime I sleep
I see you my love
Early in the morning
It's you my love
It's only you I needed
Say you'd never leave 'cause you make my life complete
It's only you
(Now only you way I want to, don't you know)
It's only you
Never seen the girl that can do the things, the things you do
It's only you (only you, only you)
Say you'd never leave me
The only you I want the way I need
Girl, it's only you
It's only you
Only you
Na you
You are the beat in my heart
When we are apart
I feel like I'm losing my mind
You're like the stars in the skies
When I look in your eyes
I believe my life is complete
'Cause it's you my love
Anytime I sleep
I see you my love
Early in the morning
It's you my love
It's only you I needed
Say you'd never leave cause you make my life complete
It's only you
It's only you
Never seen the girl that can do the things, the things you do
It's only you (Only you, only you)
Say you'd never leave me
The only you I want the way I need
Girl it's only you
Only you
It's only you
It's only you
You doo doo
It's you my love
Anytime I sleep
I see you
Early in the morning
It's you
It's only you I need
Say you'd never leave, 'cause you make my life complete
It's only you
It's only you
Never seen the girl that can do the things the things you do
It's only you (Only you, only you)
Say you'd never leave me
The only you I want's the way I need
Only you
